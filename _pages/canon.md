I originally tried to organize this list into categories like "economics", "philosophy", etc. But I realized that so many of these exist on the border of categories or in multiple. In fact, a high signal of deserving to be on this list is that a piece of work should be so impactful, it fundamentally changes my worldview in many categories of life, not just one.  So therefore, here is a random assorted list of my personal canon.
